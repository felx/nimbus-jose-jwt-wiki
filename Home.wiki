= Nimbus JOSE+JWT =

Nimbus JOSE+JWT is a Java library that implements the **Javascript Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE)** spec suite and the closely related **JSON Web Token (JWT)** spec. 

== Supported JOSE and JWT objects ==

The library supports creating, querying, serialising and parsing of the 
following JOSE and JWT objects:

	* Plain (unsecured) JOSE objects.
	
	* JSON Web Signature (JWS) objects.
	
	* JSON Web Encryption (JWE) objects.
	
	* JSON Web Key (JWK) objects and JSON Web Key (JWK) Sets.
	
	* Plain, signed and encrypted JSON Web Tokens (JWTs).

== Fully decoupled JOSE/JWT object representation from crypto algorithm implementation ==

The JOSE and JWT object representation is completely decoupled from JSON Web Algorithm (JWA) implementations through a set of simple interfaces for signing, verifying, encrypting and decrypting the objects.


== Standard JWS algorithms fully implemented, JWE algorithms on the roadmap ==

The library currently ships a ready implementation of the following standard 
algorithms:

	* HMAC signatures with **HS256**, **HS384** and **HS512**.
	
	* RSA signatures with **RS256**, **RS384** and **RS512**.
	
	* EC signatures with **ES256**, **ES384** and **ES512**.


== Example JWS object use ==

Check the //examples// directory for complete Java code.

{{{
// Create JWS payload
Payload payload = new Payload("Hello world!");
                
// Create JWS header with HS256 algorithm
JWSHeader header = new JWSHeader(JWSAlgorithm.HS256);
header.setContentType("text/plain");
                
// Create JWS object
JWSObject jwsObject = new JWSObject(header, payload);
                
// Create HMAC signer
String sharedKey = "a0a2abd8-6162-41c3-83d6-1cf559b46afc";
                
JWSSigner signer = new MACSigner(sharedKey.getBytes());
jwsObject.sign(signer);
                        
// Serialise JWS object to compact format
String s = jwsObject.serialize();
System.out.println("Serialised JWS object: " + s);
                
// Parse back and check signature
jwsObject = JWSObject.parse(s);

JWSVerifier verifier = new MACVerifier(sharedKey.getBytes());
                
boolean verifiedSignature = jwsObject.verify(verifier);

if (verifiedSignature)
    System.out.println("Verified JWS signature!");
else
    System.out.println("Bad JWS signature!");

System.out.println("Recovered payload message: " + jwsObject.getPayload());

== Dependencies ==

The Nimbus JOSE+JWT library has minimal dependencies.

        * Apache Commons Codec for Base64 and Base64URL encoding and decoding.

        * JSON Smart for highly efficient parsing and serialisation of JSON. 

        * [optional] The BouncyCastle.org cryptography provider for Java, for 
          ECDSA signing and verification.

== Uses ==

        * JWT bearer tokens in OAuth 2.0
        
        * OpenID Connect
        
        * XMPP


== About us ==

The principal maintainer of this library is Nimbus Directory Services 
[http://NimbusDS.com]. The initial code was based on JWS/JWE/JWT crypto classes
factored out of the OpenInfoCard project. A rewrite to fully decouple JOSE + JWT
object representation from crypto algorithm implementation led to the next major 
2.0 release in October 2012.

You're welcome to contribute crypto handlers for standard algorithms which have
not been implemented yet (most JWE algorithms).
